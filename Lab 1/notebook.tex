    Robotic Systems

Lab 1

    

    In this lab session, you will get to know the Romi robot that you will
be using throughout these labs and for the coursework assessments. The
Romi is a differential drive robot from Polulu. It is controlled by an
ATMEL ATMEGA32u4 Microcontroller, which is included on the integrated
32u4 Control, also by Polulu.

    You can find a full reference documentation for the Romi on the Polulu
website \href{https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J69}{here}. The 32u4 is the
same Microcontroller used on the Arduino Leonardo board, meaning we can
program it using the Arduino IDE. Other methods of uploading code are
available, but will not be supported in this course. The arduino IDE is
pre-installed on all lab machines (alongside the necessary drivers). If
you wish to install the necessary software on your own machine, there is
a guide \href{https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J69/5}{here}

    Aside

This course has a large number of students, meaning a wide variety of
backgrounds and experience levels. Most lab worksheets for this course
will consist of 5 exercises, numbered 1-5. Our expectation is that most
students will start with exercise 2 and complete the majority of
exercises 2-4 within the lab session. Exercise 1 is designed to provide
a gentle introduction to the lab for those students who are less
confident with the material being covered. Exercise 5 is designed to
provide a more challenging exercise for those students who are already
familiar with the topic being covered. As this is a Masters level
course, we expect you to exercise your own judgement about which
exercises are valuable learning experiences for you.

    Exercise 1: Uploading code

    In this exercise, we will see our first piece of code, try to understand
its parts, and upload it to the Romi control board.

    The Atmega 32u4 and similar processors (such as the Atmega328p used in
the Arduini Uno) can be programmed in C/C++. We assume some familiarity
with basic programming in this course - if you have programmed in
another language and are new to C/C++, we believe these materials should
serve as a suitable introduction to C++ (for microcontrollers). If you
have never programmed before, we recommend you follow one of the many
introductory courses online and seek support (Perhaps in the MSc
Robotics Dropin session). This code can be transferred from your PC to
the Romi via USB with the Arduino IDE

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open the Arduino IDE from the start menu
\item
  Select File -\/-\textgreater{} Examples -\/-\textgreater{} 01.Basics
  -\/-\textgreater{} Blink
\end{enumerate}

You should see the following code
/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
    Let's break this down a little bit. The code between lines 1 and 23 is
enclosed by '/\emph{' and '}/' and is known as a comment. This is not
code, but text left by the developer of the code to help others
understand the code. Comments may also be marked by a double slash '//'.

Starting on line 26 (and below another comment), we have the setup
function. The code contained in this function is run once, when the Romi
is turned on. This function contains a single line:

\texttt{pinMode(LED\_BUILTIN,\ HIGH);}

A Microcontroller such as the Atmega32u4 contains a number of pins, some
of which can be configured as either an input or an output. See
\href{https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins}{here} for further
details. This line calls the function pinMode with two arguments: the
first, LED\_BUILTIN refers to a pin connected to a built in LED on the
Romi board. In this case, it is the Orange LED on the left hand side of
the board (Also known as Pin 13). The second argument enables a built-in
pull up resistor connected to the LED\_PIN (See
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor}{here} for further
information about pull up resistors).

    Next, we have the main loop. This function will be called repeatedly by
the Microcontroller. In this case, we first see the line:

\texttt{digitalWrite(LED\_BUILTIN,\ HIGH);}

This tells the microcontroller to set the voltage of the LED\_BUILTIN
pin to be high (5V in this case). This causes current to flow through
the LED, turning it on. Next we have the line:

\texttt{delay(1000);}

This tells the microcontroller to wait for 1000 milliseconds. Next, we
set the LED\_BUILTIN pin low (turning off the LED), before delaying for
another second.

    To upload this code to the Romi, you must first tell the IDE which type
of microcontroller you wish to upload code to. To do this, select Tools
-\/-\textgreater{} Board -\/-\textgreater{} Polulu A star 32u4. Then you
can either press \texttt{Ctrl-U} or the upload code button (The Arrow
point to the right in the top left hand corner of the IDE).

    Tasks

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Upload the Blink sketch to the 32u4
\item
  Change the frequency of the LED flash to 5 Hz.
\end{enumerate}

    Exercise 2: Serial Communication

    Often, we will want to communicate with a microcontroller. We can use
the Serial protocol to do so. This protocol uses two pins (RX, connected
to pin 0 and TX, connected to pin 1) to communicate via the USB port.
The Arduino IDE has a built in Serial monitor which allows us to read
and write data on this connection in real time. For more details on the
Serial protocol, you can go
