Our expectation is that <b>most</b> students will start with exercise 1 or 2 and complete the majority of exercises 2-4 within the lab session. Exercise 1 is designed to provide a gentle introduction to the lab for those students who are less confident with the material being covered. Exercise 5 is designed to provide a more challenging exercise for those students who are already familiar with the topic being covered. As this is a Master's level course, we expect you to use your own judgement about which exercises are valuable learning experiences for you.\n",

If you have never programmed before, we recommend you follow one of the many introductory courses online and seek support (Perhaps in the MSc Robotics Dropin session). If you have used C/C++ before, but not programmed a micro-controller before, that will almost certainly be sufficient background.

Note that you may also see an unsigned integer, which uses 2 bytes to represent positive numbers only (Giving a range of 0 to 65,535).

Note that due to the way floats are stored, arithmetic operations on floats may give unexpected results. For example, 6.0 / 3.0 may not be exactly equal to 2.0.

We can set the power of the Buzzer by using the `analogWrite(PIN, <0-255>)` function. This function creates a PWM signal on the pin, with a duty factor between 0 (If we set the second argument to 0) and 1 (if we set the second argument to 255). We will look at PWM signals in more detail in lab 2, so don't worry  if you are unsure what this means - for now, we just need to now that if we set 0, we will get a low volume, if we set 255, we will get a high volume, and we can get volumes in the middle of these, by setting numbers between 0 and 255.
